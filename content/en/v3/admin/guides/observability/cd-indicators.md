description: How to install and use the Continuous Delivery Indicators addon for Jenkins X
weight: 130
---

This guide will help you install, configure and use the [Continuous Delivery Indicators](https://github.com/jenkins-x/cd-indicators) addon in your Jenkins X cluster.

This addon will automatically:

- collect metrics from cluster events and git events: pull requests, pipelines, releases, deployments, ...
- store them in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
- expose [Grafana](http://grafana.com/) dashboards to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators

This is an example of a pre-defined dashboard to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators for a single repository (application):

## Installation

Note that this addon requires a running Grafana instance in your cluster, so you should install it first, using the [platform observability guide](/v3/admin/guides/observability/platform-observability/).

Please follow the usual [getting started guide for boot and helm 3](/v3/admin/platform/) first.

Installing this addon is a 1 step operation: you need to edit the `helmfiles/jx/helmfile.yaml` file in your development environment git repository, so that it references the `jx3/cd-indicators` chart, such as:

```yaml
releases:
- chart: jx3/cd-indicators
- chart: ...
...
```

Commit and push these changes, and after a few minutes you should see 2 new pods running in the `jx` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n jx
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cd-indicators-57f85df9fb-fltjp   1/1     Running   0          13m
cd-indicators-postgresql-0       1/1     Running   0          13m
...
```

## Usage

This addon will also expose:

- a [Grafana datasource](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/) for the embedded PostgreSQL database - named `Indicators` - in a Kubernetes Secret
- multiple [Grafana dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/) - with the `cd-indicators` tag - in Kubernetes ConfigMaps

The Grafana instance will automatically find these new resources and use them. So if you go to your Grafana URL, you should now see a new datasource and new dashboards. Of course, it might take a few hours/days/weeks to get enough data to get nice-looking dashboards.

You can either:

- enrich the existing dashboards, and submit Pull Requests on the [cd-indicators github repository](https://github.com/jenkins-x/cd-indicators) so that everybody can benefit from your improvements
- or create your own dashboards. We recommend that you store them in a git repository, and publish them as ConfigMaps in your cluster - see the [cd-indicators github repository](https://github.com/jenkins-x/cd-indicators) for an example.

And because we're re-using the same Grafana instance which already has the Prometheus (metrics) and Loki (logs) datasources, you can build dashboards combining data from all sources, to get a complete overview of your application and its lifecycle: development, build, release, deployment, runtime.

## Configuration

The configuration is defined in a ["values file" stored in the Jenkins X Version Stream](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/tree/master/charts/jx3/cd-indicators/values.yaml).

If you want to change anything from the default configuration, you can either:

- submit a Pull Request if you believe this change is beneficial for everybody
- or create a new values file in your development environment git repositor: `values/cd-indicators/values.yaml`

You should at least configure the `gitOwners`, to ensure you will only collect metrics for your own repositories, and not for Jenkins X's own applications - see [the default values](https://github.com/jenkins-x/cd-indicators/blob/main/charts/cd-indicators/values.yaml). In your `values/cd-indicators/values.yaml` file you can write:

```yaml
config:
  gitOwners:
  - my_github_organization
```
