As a general purpose console for working with Kubernetes, Jenkins X, Tekton and more resources we highly recommend either [Octant](https://octant.dev/) or [Lens](/v3/develop/ui/lens/)

To run the [Octant](https://octant.dev/) UI please make sure you are in a local terminal (not inside a VM) as it will run a local process and open a web browser to access a local port.

Also make sure you are connected to the kubernetes cluster you wish to use first. e.g. run something like this to check you are connected first:

```bash
kubectl get ns
```

To run Octant with the Jenkins X plugins if you [have a recent jx binary](/v3/guides/upgrade/#cli) run:

```bash
jx ui
```

This will download the [octant](https://octant.dev/) binary and the [octant-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx) plugin then startup  [Octant](https://octant.dev/) for you
