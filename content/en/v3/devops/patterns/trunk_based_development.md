This approach is essentially:

* use a single branch for releases
* work in small batches  
* use Continuous Integration to frequently merge changes to the main branch
  
It is described in the [Accelerate book](/v3/devops/accelerate/).

The idea is to avoid long term feature branches which have a cost in terms of maintenance and being the opposite of Continuous Integration.

For more background see the [Trunk Based Development site](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) which has lots of examples and approaches.
