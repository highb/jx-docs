As described in the [Accelerate book](/v3/devops/accelerate/), high performing teams automate their Continuous Delivery.

This lets your team focus on delivering business value for your customers rather than writing pipelines by hand.

If you use Jenkins X for your environments and to [create projects](/v3/develop/create-project/) you will have completely automated Continuous Delivery using [Pipelines As Code](/v3/devops/patterns/pipeline_as_code/), [Preview Environments](/v3/devops/patterns/preview_environments/) and [Trunk Based Development](/v3/devops/patterns/trunk_based_development/)
