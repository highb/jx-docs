In this tutorial, we'll walk you through setting up Jenkins X on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on GKE. We will use GitHub as our Git provider.

The purpose of this tutorial is to give a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of setting up Jenkins X.

### Setup used in this tutorial

* GitHub as our Git provider and a GitHub user account, eg `MarckK`
* A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with the ability to provision kubernetes resources / create kubernetes clusters
* Jenkins X `jx` binary installed. See [here for instructions on installing the `jx` binary](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/install/).

* The Kubernetes command-line tool, which can be installed to your local installation using the `jx install` command:

```
jx install dependencies -d kubectl
```

We are going to create a GitHub organisation which will have two members, a GitHub user account, eg `MarckK`, and a GitHub 'Pipeline' bot account, eg `jx-bot`.

* We can create a new GitHub organisation by clicking the **+** at the top right of GitHub's top navigation bar or by clicking to the [create an organization page](https://github.com/organizations/plan). I chose the free 'Team for Open Source' plan for my new GitHub organisation; this means the organisation will _not_ have unlimited private repositories. Name your organisation anything you like, eg `jenkins-x-space`.

* Invite your GitHub user account, eg `MarckK`, to the organisation. This GitHub user account will create and manage development repositories.

* Next we create a GitHub Pipeline bot account. This Pipeline bot will automate pull request notifications and create preview environments for quick validation and acceptance for code merging. Your Pipeline bot should be created as a member of your GitHub organisation, eg `jenkins-x-space`.

    Create an entirely new account that will be only for your bot. Name your bot anything you like, eg `jx-bot`.

    The bot account must have a token created in your organization that authenticates the bot and allows it to perform various tasks on the repositories within your organization.

    Generate a Git token for your Pipeline Bot with the correct permissions via this [GitHub Link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,read:org,user:email,write:repo_hook,delete_repo) and **copy the 40 character token**.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

The 40 character token generated by GitHub is only shown once so you must copy this immediately before you close the browser tab or window, as the token cannot be retrieved once it is displayed. You will be asked for this token later, so please do keep a copy of it.

{{% /alert %}}

* At this point, I signed out of my GitHub Pipeline bot account and back into my GitHub user account, eg `MarckK`.

### Step 1 -  Create a Kubernetes cluster

* `jx create cluster gke` will create a cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), which you can initialise with a name. From the command-line run:

```
jx create cluster gke --skip-installation -n <cluster name>
```

* The program opens a web browser and you will be asked to choose the email address associated with your GCP account and to allow the Google Cloud SDK access to your account. After confirming, you can close the browswer page.

* Back at the command-line, the `jx create cluster` program prompts you to choose your Google Cloud Project from the available list.

* The program prompts you to choose the Zone nearest to where you would like to install your cluster. For example, if you want your cluster to serve users primarily in the east coast of the United states, you choose `us-east1-b` from the available list.

* The program runs automatically through default questions and begins creating the cluster in your specified zone.

Towards the end, you will see output similar to:

```
NAME         LOCATION         MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION    NUM_NODES  STATUS
walkthrough  europe-north1-a  1.14.10-gke.17  35.228.74.166  n1-standard-2  1.14.10-gke.17  3          RUNNING
```

Congratulations you now have a Kubernetes cluster!

### Step 2 - Installing Jenkins X on a cluster

<!-- ### Edit all this with new jx boot â€”--git-public` flag (woohoo!)

```bash
jx boot --git-public
```

Does NOT work. Just returns: `Error: unknown flag: --git-public`
This has been implemented for `jx create` or `jx install` [apparently](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/#git). Not jx boot. And unfortunately, that happens to be where I would like to have it enabled. -->

* First clone the [Jenkins X Boot configuration repo](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-boot-config) and `cd` into your newly cloned repo.

* Open the `jx-requirements.yml` file of your newly cloned repo, eg. `jenkinx-x-boot-config/jx-requirements.yml`. This specifies the requirements of your installation, including:
  * what Kubernetes provider to use
  * whether to store secrets in the local file system or vault
  * if you are using Terraform to manage your cloud resources

    Note, this is the main configuration file for `jx boot` and where you make most of your configuration changes.

    The `jx-requirements.yml` file is interesting to review, see the defaults in place, and make any changes you need.  

* For my setup, I knew there was one change I needed to make to the `jx-requirements.yml`. By default, Jenkins X will create private environment repos. You can see this configured in `jx-requirements.yml` as `environmentGitPublic: false`. However, I set up a free open source GitHub organization to hold the environment repositories that will be created by Jenkins X, and this type of GitHub organization account does not have access to private repos. To configure Jenkins X to create public environment repositories, set `environmentGitPublic` to `true` in `jx-requirements.yml`.

* Save your changes and then on the command line run:

```
jx boot
```

If you are not in a clone of a boot git repository then `jx boot` will clone this repository and `cd` into the clone.

You can read more about [Jenkins X Boot in the documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/).

Your Git and the pre-installation set up for Jenkins X will be checked and validated. You will see printed out:

`Currently connected cluster is ```<cluster_name>``` in ```<cluster_location>``` in project ```<your_chosen_project>``

You will be asked to confirm that you would like to `jx boot` your `<cluster_name>`.

Then you will be asked a series of questions to ensure Jenkins X is installed properly on your cluster:

* You will be asked to input the `Git Owner name for environment repositories`: Type in the organistion you created, eg `jenkins-x-space`.

* You will be asked to provide `Comma-separated git provider usernames of approvers for development environment repository`: Type in the name of the GitHub account that is a member of the organisation you created, eg `MarckK`.

* You may receive a Warning that `TLS is not enabled so your webhooks will be called using HTTP.` You will be asked for confirmation to continue.
  * If you type 'No', the `jx boot` process will end with `error: cannot continue because TLS is not enabled.`

  * If you type 'Yes', then namespace `jx` will be created in your cluster and Jenkins X booted in that namespace.

* You may be asked if you wish to upgrade `jx`. It is recommended you say 'Yes' and then re-run `jx boot`.

* There will be information logged on enabling storage on GKE. You do not need to enable storage for this walkthrough tutorial.

* You will see information on the pipeline steps of JX Boot.

* You will be asked `Jenkins X Admin Username`: Type in a username or press return to have the default username of `admin`.

* You will then be asked for `Jenkins X Admin Password`: Type one in.

* You will then be asked for `Pipeline bot Git username`: Type in the name of the Pipeline Bot you created, eg `jx-bot`.

* You will then be asked for `Pipeline bot Git email address`: Type in the email address you used when setting up your Pipeline Bot.

* You will then be asked for `Pipeline bot Git token`: Type in the token generated and saved previously.

* You will be asked, `Do you want to configure an external Docker Registry?`: 'No' is sufficient for this tutorial

* More pipeline steps will be run. You should see output that your pods are running and other verification information telling you the state of your Jenkins x set-up.

Then you will see confirmation on the state of your installation process, such as:

`Installation is currently looking: GOOD`

* In the organisation you created, eg `jenkins-x-space`, there should now be 3 additional repositories for the dev, staging, and production environments, which map to the dev, staging, and production namespaces in your cluster.

Jenkins X should be installed on your Kubernetes cluster. ðŸŽ‰

To see the Jenkins X environments that have been created, the corresponding GitOps git repos, and the default promotion strategy between environments:

```bash
jx get environments
```

You should see something similar to:

```bash
 NAME       LABEL       KIND        PROMOTE NAMESPACE     ORDER CLUSTER SOURCE                                                                    REF    PR
dev        Development Development Never   jx            0             https://github.com/jenkins-x-space/environment-walkthrough-dev.git        master
staging    Staging     Permanent   Auto    jx-staging    100           https://github.com/jenkins-x-space/environment-walkthrough-staging.git    master
production Production  Permanent   Manual  jx-production 200           https://github.com/jenkins-x-space/environment-walkthrough-production.git master
```

Note the following details in the PROMOTE column:

* Development has **Never** promote, because you're working locally in this environment and not deploying anything.

* The Staging environment's default is to **Auto** promote, meaning any merge performed on the repo's master branch will automatically be deployed as a new version to staging.

* The Production environment's default is to have a **Manual** promotion strategy, meaning that you will have to manually promote your staging application version into production by using a jx promotion command.

The SOURCE column shows each environment's configuration git repo.

### Step 3 - Create an application

Now that you have a working cluster with Jenkins X installed, you are going to create an
application that can be built & deployed with Jenkins X.

### Using a quickstart

JX has a `create quickstart` command that will create a build from a standardised template.
To run this command, change your directory so that you are no longer within the `jenkins-x-boot-config` directory, then type the following:

```bash
jx create quickstart --git-public=true
```

We are adding the `--git-public=true` flag to ensure that our new quickstart application will create repositories that are public on GitHub, as our freemium GitHub organisation requires.

For this example, select `golang-http`.

You will be asked a series of questions such as:

* `Do you wish to use <your GitHub user name> as the Git user name?`: Choose `y`
* `Who should be the owner of the repository?`: Choose the organisation you have created, eg `jenkins-x-space`.
* `Enter the new repository name`: Choose a name for your new application, such
as `jx-tutorial`

JX will then guide you through setting up the git repository for the application.

If this is the first application you have created, it may take a few minutes to download all
of the required builder images in order to build/deploy the application.  

To view the status of the application, you can use the following:

```bash
jx get activity -f jx-tutorial -w
```

Note: -f is for --filter and -w is for --watch

When the pipeline is complete, to view the application in each environment along with urls:

```bash
jx get applications
```

### Promote the application to production

Using the `jx promote` command, you can push this version from staging to
production.

```bash
cd jx-tutorial
```

_If you have 2FA enabled on your GitHub account, then you may need to use an api token as your password when prompted._

```bash
jx promote jx-tutorial --version 0.0.1 --env production
```

You can check the progress of the production deployment using:

```bash
jx get activity -f jx-tutorial -w
```

```bash
jx get applications
```

## Congratulations

Youâ€™re all set!

You now have a fully configured Jenkins X installation on Google Kubernetes Engine.

To avoid running up unnecessary costs, you may wish to shut down your kubernetes cluster at this point.  To view all clusters running with the current account use:

```bash
gcloud container clusters list
```

To delete the cluster run:

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete <clustername> --zone <zone>
```
