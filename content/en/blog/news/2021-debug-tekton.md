Tekton recently introduced a [debug feature](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/debug.md#debug) when you create `TaskRun` resources so that steps can be paused at a breakpoint until told to move forwards so that you can diagnose why pipeline steps fail.

The latest Tekton release only supports breakpoints on `TaskRun` resources but there is a [Pull Request #4145](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4145) to add support also to debugging `PipelineRun` resources as well. If you are reading this please add your thumbs up emoji feedback to the [PR #4145](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4145)

We've switched Jenkins X to use a preview image of Tekton with [PR #4145](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4145) included so that Jenkins X developers can easily debug their pipelines (which typically are `PipelineRun` resources).

## How to debug Tekton Pipelines

Here is a demo which shows how to debug pipelines:

### Prerequisites

Make sure [your cluster is upgraded to the latest version stream](/v3/admin/setup/upgrades/cluster/).

If you intend to use the `jx` in the below examples make sure you [upgrade the CLI too](/v3/admin/setup/upgrades/cli/)

### Enable a breakpoint

To enable a breakpoint you can:

* use the [Lens UI](/v3/develop/ui/lens/) as shown in the above video by:
  * right click on a `Pipeline` action menu
  * select `Breakpoint -> Add`
* you can use the [jx pipeline debug](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/develop/reference/jx/pipeline/debug/) command then select the pipeline to add/remove a breakpoint.

### Viewing breakpoints

You can view breakpoints in the [Lens UI](/v3/develop/ui/lens/) in the `Breakpoints` tab or via:

```bash
kubectl get lighthousebreakpoints

# you can use the short name:
kubectl get lhbp
```

### Using a breakpoint

Once you have set a breakpoint defined for a particular Pipeline you need to trigger the pipeline. e.g. perform a git commit on the git branch to trigger a new pipeline to execute.

The pipeline will execute as normal; you'll be able to view it execute via:

* [Lens UI](/v3/develop/ui/lens/)
* run [jx pipeline grid](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/develop/reference/jx/pipeline/grid/) to watch pipelines run and select the one you wish to view the log
* run [jx pipeline log](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/develop/reference/jx/pipeline/log/) to watch the log of a specific pipeline

### Opening a shell

Once your breakpoint is reached the pipeline pod will pause, waiting to continue.

At this point you can then open a shell inside the container.

The easiest way to do this is via the [Lens UI](/v3/develop/ui/lens/), click on the Pipeline action menu then `Shell` -> `latest step` and a shell will open.

Otherwise you can use:

```bash
kubectl exec -it -c $name-of-container $name-of-pod (sh | bash | ash)
```

### Continuing after the breakpoint

If you wish to continue the execution of a pipeline there are [multiple scripts you can run inside the shell](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/debug.md#debug-scripts) you can run inside the shell in the pipeline to tell the pipeline to continue:

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/tekton/debug/scripts/debug-continue` | Mark the step as completed with success by writing to `/tekton/tools` so that the pipeline continues executing |
| `/tekton/debug/scripts/debug-fail-continue` | Mark the step as completed with failure by writing to `/tekton/tools` which can lead to the pipeline terminating |

### Removing breakpoints

There are a few ways to delete breakpoints.

You can run [jx pipeline debug](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/develop/reference/jx/pipeline/debug/) and toggle off any existing breakpoints.

You can use the `Breakpoints` tab in [Lens UI](/v3/develop/ui/lens/) then click the breakpoints action menu then `Remove`

Or find the one you want via:

```bash
kubectl get lhbp
kubectl delete lhbp whatever-the-name-is
```

## Conclusion

So there you have it; nice and easy debugging of pipelines so you can diagnose why pipelines fail and try incrementally fix things up from inside the pipeline pods! Pretty cool eh!

Let us know via [slack](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack) or the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues) if you can think of any ways we can make this even easier to use! Also check out the [Tekton enhancement proposal 42](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0042-taskrun-breakpoint-on-failure.md) that covers this capability in the underlying tekton controller and pods.

Finally please add your thumbs up emoji to the [tekton PR #4145](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4145) :)
