Hear ye! Hear ye! Jenkins X Community,

cdCon 2021 (the Continuous Delivery Foundation’s annual flagship event) is happening June 23-24 and its call for papers is open!

This is your chance to share what you’ve been doing with Jenkins X. Are you building something cool? Using it to solve real-world problems? Are you making things fast? Secure? Or maybe you’re a contributor and want to share what’s new. In all cases, we want to hear from you!

Submit your talk for [cdCon 2021](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/) to be part of the conversation driving the future of software delivery for technology teams, enterprise leadership, and open-source communities.

**Submission Deadline**: Friday, March 5 at 11:59 PM PST
